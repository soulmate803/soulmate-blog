<p>Hello, everyone. I am really honor to stand on the platform to introduce myself. According to the request, the personal object I brought is a logo of BUPT debate team. As written on the badge, my name is Wang Dandi. You may have already guessed, I love debate, and it is closely related to my life.</p>

<p>First of all, I will tell you where I come from and the reason l joined debate. I come from a province which name beginning with ‘H’. Right, I come from Fujian Province and maybe my Mandarin is not good, but I want to have a chance to speak in front of everyone and make my Mandarin better. So I join the debate in my freshman year.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think the form of debate and my values are identical. There are always two teams have opposing views in a debate. In my values, I believe that everything has two sides. When we state our opinion of a certain thing, we should consider from many angles. Different people have different points of view, and debate is not a fight but to share ideas. I like to share ideas with others, so I love debate.</p>

<p>Last but not least, debate has brought me many friends and I think it is the most precious wealthy in recent years. We often go out to play board games and visit some places. I cherish these friends, and thank debate that take them to my side.</p>
