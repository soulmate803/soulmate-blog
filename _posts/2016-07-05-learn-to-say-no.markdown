<p>I'm glad to ask you some questions. Are you ever asked for a favor? If your best friend asks you to do something you really don't like, what will you do? We've been taught that we should help people, however, the face is that we can't say yes to every request and sometimes we need to say no. The trouble is that rejecting others is a difficult thing for most people, and for me, too. So, today I want to share you some my opinion about rejection.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The problem</h2>

<p>Do you realize that difficulty in rejecting may result in some trouble? Our time and energy are limited, just because of it, each time we say yes to something, we're actually saying no to something else may be more meaningful. When we say yes to do something you don't enjoy, we're saying no to something we love; when we say yes to help others to do the extra job, we're saying no to the social lives of ourselves; when we say yes to stay with someone we don't like, we're saying no to the fulfilling relationship. In many cases, the inability to say no can become a severe psychological problem, as we tend to forget to take care of ourselves and what we really want.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The causes</h2>

<p>Do you ever consider why we feel so hard to reject? According to Holly Week, a psychologist, said in Harvard Business Review, China is a traditional country with long history. People are fond to say "yes", not advocated to say "no". It is a pursuit of peaceful, harmonious, and balanced relations. We are all brought up under the notion that saying no, especially to people who are more senior, are rude. This thinking is common in Asian culture, where face-saving is important . What's more, we may be afraid of conflict, so we prefer to say yes each time. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The solution</h2>

<p>Do you want to change the situation and solve the problem? If so, here are some tips from a lesson of the University of Berkeley maybe can help you to reject properly [3]. Firstly, give yourself some time to consider whether you have enough time or energy to help others or not. Secondly, if we want to say no, we should be firm and polite. We just reject the demands of helping, and if we can tell our reason, others can understand and we can still have friendship with each. Finally, we must not feel guilty, we have the right of planning our schedule, and we have the right of rejection.</p>

<p>All in all, the situation should be changed that we neglect the needs of ourselves while simultaneously trying desperately not to hurt others with our rejection. When next time you want to reject, please be brave enough to say no.</p>
