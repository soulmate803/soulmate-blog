<blockquote>By listened the speech of I have a dream, I think the purpose of it is to reduce the discrimination against blacks, and give them full citizenship rights.</blockquote>

<p>The most important feature of the speech is that King used simile and repetition from the beginning to the end. For example, the paragraph 2, King used “it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity” to describe that significance of the thing which the great American do for blacks people and their suffering before it. What’s more, King relied heavily on the use of repetition. The repetition of “One hundred years later ” told us that although time was long past, but the discrimination against of the blacks didn’t changed. The repetition of “now is the time” and “I have a dream” told us that King’s determination to fight for the rights of black people.</p>

<p>At the same time, King also used many familiar, concrete words. He used them to make tangible the abstract principles of liberty and equality such as “sunlit path of racial justice” and “flames of withering injustice”.</p>

<p>As for the use of voice and body effectively, I think his voice was loud and contagious, and the speed of his speech was appropriately so that the audience can keep up with his space and have enough time to think about the central ideas. Unfortunately, the video can’t successfully play and the video of the URL didn’t contain enough of King’s camera, so I didn’t watch King’s body clearly. The only thing that I can remember is that he didn’t shave his body and he used his eye contact with his audience frequently. </p>
